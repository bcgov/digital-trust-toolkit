# B.C. Petroleum & Natural Gas Title - DRAFT
# 1. Primary Document

## 1.1 Introduction

The majority of subsurface petroleum and natural gas (PNG) resources in British Columbia (B.C.) are owned by the Province. By entering into a tenure agreement with the Province, private industry can develop these resources. Tenure agreements are the mechanism used by the Province to give rights to petroleum and natural gas resources through issuance of Petroleum and Natural Gas Titles. 

Further information can be found on the [BC Government Petroleum and Natural Gas Tenure Site](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/natural-gas-oil/petroleum-natural-gas-tenure).

The following legislation and regulations govern the disposition, administration and management of petroleum and natural gas in B.C.:

* 	[The Petroleum and Natural Gas Act (PNG Act)](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/00_96361_01)
* 	[The Petroleum and Natural Gas Act Regulations](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/content/complete/statreg/1922970521/96361/reg96361/?xsl=/templates/browse.xsl)
* 	[Petroleum and Natural Gas Tenure Policy Guides](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/natural-gas-oil/petroleum-natural-gas-tenure/publications)

Name | Attribute | Format | Rules | Notes	
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Title Number | title_number | String  | not NULL | A number is used to uniquely identify a title, assigned based on administrative policy by the TRSB. The title number is associated with the Exploration Licence outlined in [Section 126, part 14.126 of the PNG Act](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96361_01#section126)
Title Type | title_type | String | not NULL | This field specifies the type of title based on the [PNG Act](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96361_01). Title types can include the following: **1. Lease** ([Part 6](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96361_01#part6)); **2. Permit** ([Part 5](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96361_01#part5)); **3. Drilling Licence** ([Part 5.1](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96361_01#part5.1)), and **4. Storage Reservoir Licence** ([Part 14.130](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96361_01#section130)). Each title has only one title type.
Issue Date | issue_date | String | not NULL| The date when a title is issued, format is YYYY-MM-DD. Section 64 of the [PNG Act](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96361_01#section64)
Effective Date | effective_date | String | not NULL | The date when the title becomes effective, format YYYY-MM-DD. This date usually follows after an issuance date and signals the start of a title period. This date does not change.
Term | term | String | not NULL | This describes the length of time (term) granted for each title, expressed in YYYY. This date does not change.
Expiry Date | expiry_date | String | not NULL | Expiry date is defined as effective date plus term, expressed as YYYY-MM-DD. This date signals the end of the title period.
Area | area | String | not NULL | This attribute is the surface area in planned use, measured in hectares. This includes 3 dimensional layers. 
Title Holders | title_holders| String | not NULL | The [PNG Act](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96361_01#section130) describes a "holder of a location" as meaning "in accordance with the context, a permittee, licensee" . In this credential, the term title holder is used to reference a person in whose name a PNG title document is recorded in the division records. Title holders can be registered companies, and/or persons. A Title Holder will hold a percentage (%) interest in the title. Percent interest defines the percentage of interest allotted to each party named in the PNG title document. Percentage of ownership can be divided up to eight digits and should always equal 100% total. Lessee is defined by [the PNG Act](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96361_01) as "a person in whose name a lease is recorded in the division records". 
Tracts | tracts | String | not NULL | A **Tract** is an area of land within a title defined by locations sharing identical rights. This attribute has all of the tract(s) information contained within a title. See *Tracts Appendix* below for a detailed description of the information included.
Caveats | caveats | String | not NULL | Caveats provide information and guidance to the tenure holder that will assist in activity planning by identifying potential access restrictions. Caveats will also flag concerns identified through pre-tenure consultation and may recommend engagement with First Nations, stakeholders, and other agencies as appropriate. Caveats often point to relevant statute and policy and are not binding or enforced by the Ministry.

__**Tracts Appendix**__
* 	**Tract Numbers** On all title documents is a heading which is the Tract Number. Tract Numbers are unique identifying numbers for each tract. Tracts are an administrative device to organize all title locations sharing identical rights into separate groupings.
* 	**Tract Locations** Following the Tract Number is a description of Tract Location. Tract Location outlines the precise location for a tract listed on a PNG title document using specific attributes from one of two land survey systems currently in use within BC.
* 	**Tract Rights** Following Tract Location is a description called Tract Rights. This section defines rights as either "Included (I)" or "Excluded (E)". Zone names are coded  "Petroleum (P)" "Petroleum Natural Gas (PNG)" (or other relevant codes). Each right will be denoted by its corresponding letter. This section outlines the rights associated with each individual tract listed on a PNG title document. This would be linked with a BC business number (i.e. BC123456). Tract rights are identified using specific Code Lists. There are Stratigraphic Codes (used to define tract rights) and Standard Zone Designations.
* 	**Tract Notes** Following the description of Tract Rights is a section called Tract Notes. Tract Notes outlines specific notes or points associated with each tract. Definitions of zones used in tract rights reference specific depth intervals in the type well named in the same note. These are used to describe the type wells and the intervals in the type wells that are used to create the type. 
* 	**Stratigraphic Codes** are used to define tract rights and outline the following types of information: 1. Strata Zone Codes; 2. Descriptions; 3. Effective Dates; and 4. Expiry Dates. 
* 	**Standard Zone Designations** Following the Stratigraphic Codes, Standard Zone Designations describe the different ways by which a zone can be designated for use, defining intervals as either feet or meters. Next, the log type is identified followed by the well permit number. These codes outline 1. a standard 5-digit code; 2. descriptions of this code including geographical areas and details; 3. shortened descriptions of these details; 4. effective dates; and 6. expiry dates.
* 	**List of Stratigraphic Zone Codes used:**
    * 	 TT = To Top Of
    * 	 TB = To Base Of
    * 	 SE = Special Exclusion 
    * 	 IN = In
    * 	 FT = From Top Of 
    * 	 FB = From Base Of 
    * 	 DT = Down to Top Of 
    * 	 DB = Down to Base of
    * 	 BT = Below Top Of 
    * 	 BB = Below Base Of 
    * 	 AZ = All Zones
