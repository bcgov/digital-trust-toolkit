# BC Petroleum & Natural Gas Title Credential - DRAFT
# 1. Primary Document

## 1.1 Introduction

The majority of subsurface petroleum and natural gas resources in British Columbia (BC) are owned by the Province. By entering into a tenure agreement with the Province, private industry can develop these resources. Tenure agreements with the Province give private developers rights to petroleum and natural gas resources through Petroleum and Natural Gas Titles. Information can be found on the [BC Government Petroleum and Natural Gas Tenure Site](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/natural-gas-oil/petroleum-natural-gas-tenure).

Legislation and regulations govern the disposition, administration and management of petroleum and natural gas [BC Petroleum and Natural Gas Act](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/00_96361_01). 

The development of this documentation follows the governance framework created by the [Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP)](https://trustoverip.org/) [Governance Metamodel Specification](https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf) created by the [Governance Stack Working Group (GSWG)](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group).

Then it identifies the log type. Then it identifies the well by the well permit number. These codes outline (1) a standard 5 digit code (3) descriptions of this code including descriptions of geographical areas and details (4) shortened descriptions of these details (5) effective dates (6) expiry dates.
| | | | | **Tract Notes** Following the description of Tract Rights is a section called Tract Notes. Tract Notes outlines specific notes or points associated with each tract. Definitions of zones used in tract rights reference specific depth intervals in the type well named in the same note. _Specify format used_. These are used to describe the type wells and the intervals in the type wells that are used to create the type. 
Caveats | caveats | String | not NULL | Caveats provide information and guidance to the tenure holder that will assist in activity planning by identifying potential access restrictions. Caveats will also flag concerns identified through pre-tenure consultation and may recommend engagement with First Nations, stakeholders, and other agencies as appropriate.
