[BC Wallet](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/government-id/bc-wallet#get) is an app for mobile devices that stores digital credentials in a secure and privacy preserving way. Held in BC Wallet, digital credentials can be used to prove something about a user or their business to other individuals or public and private organizations. <br></br>

There are two main components, both under the [OpenWallet Foundation](https://openwallet.foundation/), that are powering the BC Wallet.
