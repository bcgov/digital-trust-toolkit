A flexible guide to support adopters through the phases of digital trust adoption.

## Supporting Adoption
The Delivery Manual, designed to facilitate digital trust adoption, includes targeted activities and workshops to guide adopters through various adoption phases while accommodating their unique needs. It serves as a flexible framework, recognizing the specific challenges each adopter may face at different points of their journey.

## The Delivery Process
Structured around four main phases—**Align**, **Discover**, **Trial**, and **Scale**—the Delivery Manual allows for iterative learning and continuous improvement, helping adopters navigate the complexities of digital trust adoption incrementally.

1. **Align Phase**

Establish shared goals, connect with stakeholders and identify potential opportunities for the project.
