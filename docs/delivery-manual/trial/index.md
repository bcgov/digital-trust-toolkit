## Overview
In the Trial Phase, you'll build and test an MVP, engage with trial participants, issue and/or verify credentials, and measure performance. This phase is crucial for validating your digital trust solution in a real-world context before broader implementation.

## Key outcomes

1.  **Preparation and MVP Build**: Develop your issuer and verifier services with support from the Digital Trust team. Build and prepare an MVP for the trial.
    
2.  **Participant engagement**:  
    Identify and recruit potential participants for the trial, informing them about the process and expectations.
    
3.  **Issuance and verification**:  
    Issue digital credentials to participants and verify these credentials, allowing participants to experience the full cycle of the digital trust solution.

4.  **Performance evalutation**: 
    Collect and analyze performance metrics and user feedback to determine the trial's success and inform decisions about scaling.

## Core Activities
Core Activities are key tasks to complete during the Align phase, either independently or with Digital Trust team support, to prepare for adoption.

## Considerations

-   **Participant Selection**: Ensure a diverse and representative group of users for the trial.
    
-   **Technical support**: IHave robust support mechanisms in place for participants during the trial.
    
-   **Flexibility:** Be prepared to make quick adjustments based on feedback and performance metrics.
