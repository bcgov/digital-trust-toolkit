BC Government uses the CANdy Network for some digital trust functionality and adheres to this [CANdy Governance Framework](https://iccs-isac.github.io/Gouvernance-CICAN-ICDTC-Governance/CANdy%20Network/CANdy-Network-Governance-Framework). For broader context about the Intergovernmental Collaboration on Digital Trust and Credentials (ICDTC), see the program overview on the [Digital Trust website](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/digital-trust/about/). <!-- Debug info: Added ICDTC reference per issue #180 -->
