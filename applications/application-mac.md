## Mining Association of Canada (MAC) Governance Framework - Draft

# 1. Primary Document

## 1.1. Introduction 

This document articulates the governance framework for the Mining Association of Canada (MAC) as an actor involved in the verifiable credential exchanges [(layer four application of the Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP) model)](https://www.trustoverip.org/wp-content/toip-model/).

The development of this documentation follows the governance framework created by the [Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP)](https://trustoverip.org/) [Governance Metamodel Specification](https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf) created by the [Governance Stack Working Group (GSWG)](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group).

## 1.2. Terminology and Notation 

[Glossary - General Trust Over IP Terms](https://trustoverip.github.io/toip/glossary)

**Requirements** include any combination of Machine-Testable Requirements and Human-Auditable Requirements. Unless otherwise stated, all Requirements MUST be expressed as defined in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

- Mandates are Requirements that use a MUST, MUST NOT, SHALL, SHALL NOT or REQUIRED keyword.
- Recommendations are Requirements that use a SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, or RECOMMENDED keyword.
- Options are Requirements that use a MAY or OPTIONAL keyword.

**Machine-Testable Requirements** are those with which compliance can be verified using an automated test suite and appropriate scripting or testing software.

**Rules** are Machine-Testable Requirements that are written in a Machine-Readable language and can be processed by a Rules Engine. They are expressed in a structured rules language as specified by the Governance Framework.

**Human-Auditable Requirements** are those with which compliance can only be verified by an audit of people, processes, and procedures.

**Policies** are Human-Auditable Requirements written using standard conformance terminology. The Policies used in the Governance Framework will use the standard terminology detailed in RFC 2119 keywords. Note that all RFC 2119 keywords have weight from an auditing perspective. An implementer MUST explain why a SHOULD or RECOMMENDED requirement was not implemented and SHOULD explain why a MAY requirement was implemented.

**Specifications** are documents containing any combination of Machine-Testable Requirements and Human-Auditable Requirements needed to produce technical interoperability.

## 1.6. Purpose

The purpose of this governance framework is to describe the rules/policies/procedures for verifiable credential exchanges involving Mining Association of Canada (MAC) with the open global community. The purpose of the rules is to enable all actors to understand agreed upon standards, terminology and processes that allow the community to interact with MAC in a trusted manner. This will help determine a governing framework and operating model for a global ecosystem that identifies how credentials can be issued, held, and verified. 

## 1.7. Scope 

Mining Association of Canada (MAC) is a participant in an open ecosystem and the focus of this framework is to describe the process MAC uses for digital exchanges on Indy networks.

## 1.8. Objectives

_This section states the high-level outcomes desired by the trust community through its adoption of the GF._

1. SHOULD specify tangible, achievable results (e.g. SMART criteria and Fit-for-Purpose criteria).
2. MUST only contain outcomes over which the GF has the authority and mechanisms to achieve within its
scope.
3. MUST be consistent with the principles of the GF (below).


## 1.9. Principles 

The Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM) program created by the MAC has a set of [Guiding Principles](https://mining.ca/download/36658/), which all participating members must commit to. These [Guiding Principles](https://mining.ca/download/36658/), address the expectation of its members towards adopting social, economic and environmental practices that align with the priorities and values of their communities of interest.
